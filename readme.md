My project consists of butterflies being around the world. I know I don't have all listed (as there is too many to name), but they hold a special place in my heart because spiritually, they mean change is coming or approaching.

I chose to do flip cards, an accordion, and a contact form. I changed from the RevealScroll to the accordion prior to the project plan.

I like what I've incorporated and I hope it's acceptable! I had fun making it, while it also was challenging.
